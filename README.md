## ðŸ¦– What is trex?
trex is template manager in the form of a CLI app. You can creat, organise, and clone-from template directories. It doesn't matter if the template is a directory on your machine or a GitHub repository: with trex you only need a few seconds to actually get to coding. Not only that, but trex is really easy to use.

## ðŸš§ Features and Roadmap
- [x] Organise templates (create, remove, list)
- [x] Make project from local directory template
- [ ] Make project from GitHub template  
- [x] Create git repository on creation
- [ ] Run scripts automatically on creation
- [ ] Create virtualenv automatically and import requirements on creation

## Install trex

> âš  As of right now, I do not own the `trex` PyPi package name. This is just a filler for now.

trex is available on PyPi and can be installed via pip with the following command:
```
pip install trex
```
Check if the installation was successful:
```
trex version
```
