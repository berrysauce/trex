## This is trex ðŸ¦–

trex is template manager in the form of a CLI app. You can creat, organise, and clone-from template directories. It doesn't matter if the template is a directory on your machine or a GitHub repository: with trex you only need a few seconds to actually get to coding. Not only that, but trex is really easy to use.

## Why you should use trex

Getting started with a new project? trex helps you out by initialising a project directory with a virtual environment and all packages installed in one command. This makes creating a new FastAPI project, for example, even easier.

- [x] Make project from local directory template

## How to install trex
